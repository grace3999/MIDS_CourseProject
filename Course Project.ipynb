Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)? Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help? Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources provided by your employer?

Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)? Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help? Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources provided by your employer?

Would you feel more comfortable talking to your coworkers about your physical health or your mental health?  \\\n",
