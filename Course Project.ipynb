Does your employer provide mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage? Do you know the options for mental health care available under your employer-provided health coverage? Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)? Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help? Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources provided by your employer? If a mental health issue prompted you to request a medical leave from work, how easy or difficult would it be to ask for that leave? Would you feel more comfortable talking to your coworkers about your physical health or your mental health?  \\\n",

Does your employer provide mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage? Do you know the options for mental health care available under your employer-provided health coverage? Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)? Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help? Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources provided by your employer? If a mental health issue prompted you to request a medical leave from work, how easy or difficult would it be to ask for that leave? Would you feel more comfortable talking to your coworkers about your physical health or your mental health?  \\\n",
